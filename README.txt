1. validation_v0.py -> train an autoencoder
2. generateDatasets -> generate datasets from the generated latent spaces
(first get the raw link for each model at github origin)

after running these two routines, one can run:

proj1 (classifiers performance)
proj1.1. MAUC_Exp.py # use latent vectors as features
proj1.2. MAUC_rawExp.py # run using the original features (618 in total)
